# N-Queens

This component is a visualization tool for the N-Queens problem. The core of
it is in `n-queens-engine.js`, which contains an "engine" for generating states
for the visualization. These states are fed into `NQueens.js`, which provides a
control panel for users to control the visualization. Finally, `NQueens.scss`
provides various styles for the display. See
https://btjanaka.net/widgets#n-queens for the rendered version of this
component.
