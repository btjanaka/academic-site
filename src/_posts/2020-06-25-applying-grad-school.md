Having applied to CS PhD programs over the past year or so, I decided to write
down a few lessons I learned.<!--excerpt-separator--> To begin, I will talk
about my overall experience. The summer after high school (2017), I took the
GRE, as I knew I wanted to pursue some kind of graduate education, and the GRE
was not much of a stretch after the SAT and ACT. Then, around March or April of
last year (2019), I began talking to various professors about what grad school
entailed, and whether it would be a good fit for me. Eventually, I decided to
pursue a PhD, so I began applying to the [NSF GRFP](https://nsfgrfp.org) (a
fellowship for grad students) around May. Then in fall (October/November), I
began applying to CS PhD programs. Ultimately, I applied to nine grad schools
and was accepted into two. Eventually, I chose to go to USC. With that said,
below is a list of things I learned. Some items come from first-hand experience,
while others were passed along to me.

1. **Figure out what you're getting yourself into.** Grad school is no small
   undertaking. Basically, you'll be spending up to 6 years (hopefully not more)
   working full-time as a researcher in your advisor's lab. Unlike in
   undergraduate, courses will be secondary; i.e. you'll have to take a few, but
   they will mostly be aimed at supplementing your research. In short, grad
   school is more like a job than "school." One article I found particularly
   helpful in understanding grad school was
   [this blog post](https://stefanosnikolaidis.blogspot.com/2018/12/7-rules-of-grad-school-game.html)
   from my advisor at USC.
   - Some folks have asked whether they should do a master's before / instead of
     a PhD. My general impression is that master's degrees are more focused on
     coursework, though many programs do involve writing a thesis. In general,
     if you want to pursue a career in research, PhD is the way to go. A PhD is
     essentially full-time research, and many PhD programs allow you to petition
     for a master's anyway (e.g. USC lets you grab a master's after you finish
     the PhD coursework). Furthermore, PhD programs are typically funded, while
     master's programs can get pretty expensive. If you are thinking of going
     into a master's and then PhD, keep in mind that a master's is not required
     to pursue a PhD (i.e. you can go straight from undergrad to PhD), and a
     master's will not necessarily take time off your PhD.
1. **Talk to as many people as possible.** Get advice from lots of people when
   you are trying to figure out the program and school to which you should
   apply. Anyone familiar with a PhD (especially professors and other folks who
   have done one) can help you decide 1) whether you actually want a PhD (hint:
   it's not for everybody) and 2) what you would study during it. Keep in mind
   that during all this, you will receive many viewpoints, some conflicting with
   each other. It is up to you to distill the information that is helpful for
   your situation. Side note: there are tons of online articles with PhD advice
   (such as this one :wink:). I also found these helpful, but only for figuring
   out the basics.
1. **Figure out an area in which to specialize.** You should be going into a PhD
   program with a general idea of what problems you want to work on. This will
   help you decide which professors you want to work with, as well as what you
   write in your various application materials. Certainly, this will require
   some soul searching -- read some papers, think about your history, and figure
   out what you want to work on next. Choosing an interest is important because,
   even within a specific field, there is still a tremendous amount of knowledge
   to learn.
1. **Choose the professor(s), not just the school.** Grad school is all about
   the professor and the people, since you are basically picking your boss and
   coworkers for the next several years. Thus, as you select schools, make sure
   you are looking through professors' publications/websites and finding ones
   who interest you. You may also want to check whether the school has multiple
   professors working in your field of interest, as having a community of
   like-minded researchers can be beneficial. To this end,
   [CS rankings](http://csrankings.org) is a great website for finding prominent
   schools and professors in your field of interest.
1. **Aim for a young professor.** Someone who is early in their career, such as
   an assistant professor, will have more time to work with you, and they will
   need to ensure the success of their students so that they can obtain tenure.
   Older professors will of course be enthusiastic about working with you, but
   they may also be bogged down by administrative or other responsibilities that
   prevent them from spending as much time with students.
1. **Email professors who you may be interested in working with.** If you are
   genuinely interested in working with certain professors, spend some time to
   compose an email asking about their recent research. Importantly, **do not**
   go around asking professors if they will accept you, but **do** ask if they
   are accepting students for their lab. If a professor is not taking any
   students, your application will be wasted. For those afraid to cold-email
   professors, I can only say that the worst that can happen is that you get
   ignored. As a disclaimer, I did not email too many professors, but the ones
   at USC that I did email ended up replying and accepting me :grin:. Also: Some
   professors will explicitly ask that you _not_ email them -- in this case, I
   suggest not emailing them.
1. **Choose your recommenders carefully.** Recommenders must be people who know
   you well enough that they can write a letter about your ability to do
   independent research. Ideally, they are professors with whom you have done
   research. If you have not done research with enough professors, I would
   suggest getting to know some other professors in your classes by going to
   their office hours. A quarter/semester of going to a professor's office hours
   to ask about class material and grad school advice can end up being enough to
   write a recommendation. Above all, do not be afraid to ask for a
   recommendation. Writing recommendations is a regular part of a professor's
   job, and if they know you well enough, they will be more than willing to help
   you.
1. **Ask your recommenders early, and keep them in the loop.** Give your
   recommenders as much time as possible to write your recommendations. By June
   of last year, I had asked two of my recommenders, and by the end of the
   summer, I had asked my third. As I applied, I kept them updated on my list of
   grad schools, and I let them know when I had sent out requests for letters
   (usually, the application system lets you send a letter request to your
   recommender; the recommender then opens this email and submits the letter).
1. **The personal statement is the part that you can control.** Most of your
   application will already be set by the time you start applying. Your GPA
   probably will not change much, your GRE scores will be set (unless you want
   to torture yourself again), your recommenders will write what they want to
   write, and you will not suddenly gain a plethora of new research experiences.
   However, the personal statement is something that you can change _right now_,
   so make sure that it is pristine.
1. **Get everyone to review your application.** This is especially true for the
   personal statement. Send it to as many people as you can -- not just the
   professors / recommenders you are working with, but also counselors, family
   members, and (especially) peers. In particular, I found it really helpful to
   get advice from friends who had just applied to and entered grad school, as
   well as friends who were currently applying to grad school. As for the other
   parts of the application, such as the CV, I would recommend sending them to
   just a few people, as there's not as much wriggle room in them (i.e. your CV
   is not going to change much).
1. **Consider if you want to go abroad.** The advice in this list is tailored to
   US programs, but you can always consider places like the UK (e.g.
   [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk)), Canada (e.g. [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/)),
   and Singapore (e.g. [NUS](http://nus.edu.sg)). Keep in mind that the
   processes and programs in other countries may be different. For instance, UK
   PhD programs tend to be much shorter than US ones. I myself briefly
   considered going abroad, but decided that immigration would be too much of a
   hassle.
1. **Apply to fellowships too.** Fellowships like the
   [NSF GRFP](https://nsfgrfp.org) provide funding to graduate students and look
   great on your CV. Some schools also have offices dedicated to helping
   students apply to such awards. For example, UCI has the
   [Scholarship Opportunities Program](http://scholars.uci.edu).
1. **Start early.** Applying to grad school is a very long and tiring process,
   and you will need as much time as you can get. Starting early means you have
   more time to write your essays and get reviews from professors and anyone
   else helping you. If you're reading this article a couple months before you
   would apply, I suppose you're already on the right track :smiley:.
1. **The application process does not end with _submit_.** Sorry, but you're not
   done when you hit the submit button on your application. Though applications
   are typically due in mid-December (with some in late November or early
   January), expect to be contacted for interviews and visits with professors
   starting in January. Essentially, before choosing to work with you for the
   next several years, professors will want to know more about you than they can
   glean from your application. In general, to prepare for these interviews, I
   would suggest reviewing the professor's recent work and making sure you can
   answer questions about everything on your application, especially research
   experiences. Of course, make sure to ask if there is anything you should
   prepare when a professor contacts you.

With that, I hope this list helped clarify some areas of the PhD application
process. Good luck, and feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments below!
