As someone who has interned three times at Google, I have been asked several
times for advice on finding an internship.<!--excerpt-separator--> To avoid
repeating myself, I figured I would compile my tips into this blog post. Without
further ado, here they are.

1. **Recognize what you're applying to.** At a company like Google, you won't be
   running around grabbing coffee. Rather, you'll be working next to engineers
   on real projects. The same goes for other roles like BOLD (the business
   internship) and APM (the product manager internship).
1. **You're never going to feel ready.** Most of the time, you're probably going
   to feel that you still do not have "enough" skills, or that all your peers
   are somehow "ahead" of you. Don't be your own worst enemy -- just apply!
1. **Talk to as many people as you can.** Everyone has something to share, and
   by listening to their advice, you will be able to distill the bits that are
   important to your specific case.
1. **Get your resume reviewed.** Pass your resume around to your friends and/or
   visit the career center at your school (such as the
   [Division of Career Pathways](https://career.uci.edu) at UCI) to get it
   reviewed.
1. **Practice for the interview.** This should go without saying, but when it
   comes time for the interview, you need to make sure that technical skills are
   not the issue. Use websites such as
   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) and
   [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to hone your skills, and practice
   coding on a Google doc while being mock-interviewed by a friend on the phone
   (intern interviews tend to be phone interviews). There's plenty of other
   interview tips scattered throughout the web; just do a Google search :wink:.
1. **Pay attention to networking opportunities.** Companies will often partner
   with student organizations to host information sessions about their company.
   These are a great way to learn the nuances of the application process and
   (potentially) give your resume to a recruiter. Career fairs are another
   opportunity to meet recruiters, though the lines are often very long.
   Finally, attending conferences like the
   [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org) (for women) can greatly
   enhance your chances of getting an internship.
1. **Ask for referrrals.** If there are any Google employees in your network,
   even current interns, make sure to ask if they would be willing to refer you.
   Keep in mind that the better someone knows you, the more genuine their
   referral will be.
1. **Don't give up!** You might not get in on your first attempt, so keep on
   trying.
1. **It's a lot easier to go back once you get in.** This is more of a statement
   than a tip, but after interning at Google once, it is relatively easy to
   return as an intern. I interned as an EP (now known as STEP) intern in my
   first year, and returned twice as a SWE intern.
1. **Keep in mind that Google is not necessarily the end of the line.** As many
   will tell you,
   [the average employee tenure at Google is only 3.2 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/average-employee-tenure-retention-at-top-tech-companies-2018-4?op=1#at-facebook-a-25-year-stint-is-the-average-5).
   Personally, I find this statistic hard to believe, as so many of the people I
   have met at Google have been around for much longer -- the article does not
   mention it, but maybe they include interns in the calculations? Regardless,
   the point is the same: Google is great, but for many, it is just one step in
   a long journey.
