I am an undergraduate computer science major at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/).
Currently, I work with [Roy Fox](https://royf.org/) on hierarchical
reinforcement learning and with the [Mobley Lab](https://mobleylab.org/) on
molecular dynamics force fields. I also serve as Internal Vice President of
[ACM@UCI](http://acm-uci.org/), and I have interned at
[Google](https://google.com) for two summers.

My main interests are in robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly
hierarchical reinforcement and imitation learning and human-robot collaboration.
I am also interested in computational chemistry, competitive programming, and
web development.

During high school, I competed in the
[VEX Robotics Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEX_Robotics_Competition)
with team 86868: The Resistance and won the 2017 VEX Robotics High School World
Championship.
