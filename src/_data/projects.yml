    Falls are one of the leading causes of injury for the elderly. To help solve
    this problem, Safeline uses a Raspberry Pi camera to continuously scan for
    falls. Once a fall is detected, Safeline alerts connected users by pushing a
    notification to their iPhones. These users can then seek medical assistance
    for the fall victim.
