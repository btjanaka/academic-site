        Competitive Programming Solutions Manager (CPSM) is a tool for managing
        solutions to programming problems, particularly competitive programming
        problems. It allows one to easily create and save new solution files
        from templates.

        Falls are one of the leading causes of injury for the elderly. To help
        solve this problem, Safeline uses a Raspberry Pi camera to continuously
        scan for falls. Once a fall is detected, Safeline alerts connected users
        by pushing a notification to their iPhones. These users can then seek
        medical assistance for the fall victim.
