        Hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms typically use a
        high-level controller to compose sub-policies sequentially or
        combinationally. Inspired by work on ensembles, we developed an
        algorithm, ACBC (Actor-Critic By Committee), in which outputs from
        multiple sub-policies, or experts, are composed with a linear
        combination. As the experts can control their weights, ACBC performs
        both sequential and combinational composition without a high-level
        controller. This work was carried out in UCI's Intelligent Dynamics Lab.

        This project was completed with the "High Entropy Homies" team as part
        of the Spring 2020 offering of CS 172B at UC Irvine. In it, we explore
        the performance differences from using various audio features to detect
        bird sounds in the <a

        Competitive Programming Solutions Manager (CPSM) is a tool for managing
        solutions to programming problems, particularly competitive programming
        problems. It allows one to easily create and save new solution files
        from templates.

        Falls are one of the leading causes of injury for the elderly. To help
        solve this problem, Safeline uses a Raspberry Pi camera to continuously
        scan for falls. Once a fall is detected, Safeline alerts connected users
        by pushing a notification to their iPhones. These users can then seek
        medical assistance for the fall victim.
